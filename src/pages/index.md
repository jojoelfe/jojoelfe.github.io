Hi,

I'm Johannes, a scientist and open-source enthusiast situated in Boston, MA. Currently, I work as a research specialist in the Grigorieff Lab at UMass Chan Medical School/HHMI.

My research interests are the mechanism of mechanosensation during hearing and hematopoietic differentiation and malignancies. I love developing new methods to understand how these things work. At the moment, I believe that cryo-electron microscopy of native tissues is the best path to solve my reserach questions.

I enjoy creating software and visualizations using python, whatever web-technology is hot right now, blender and C++. 

If you want to talk about science, software, or anything inbetween you can contact me by email or slack: jojotux123 at hotmail.com.
