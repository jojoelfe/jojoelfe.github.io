  <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Hi, I'm Johannes</h1>
  <p class="text-xl mt-4">A scientist and open-source enthusiast situated in Boston, MA. Currently, I work as a research specialist in the Grigorieff Lab at UMass Chan Medical School/HHMI.</p>
  <p class="text-lg mt-4">My research interests are the mechanism of mechanosensation during hearing and hematopoietic differentiation and malignancies. I love developing new methods to understand how these things work. At the moment, I believe that cryo-electron microscopy of native tissues is the best path to solve my research questions.</p>
  <p class="text-lg mt-4">I enjoy creating software and visualizations using Python, whatever web-technology is hot right now, Blender, and C++.</p>
  <p class="text-lg mt-4">If you want to talk about science, software, or anything in between you can contact me by email or Slack: jojotux123 at hotmail.com.</p>
