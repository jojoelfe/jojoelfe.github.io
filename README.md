## Ideas

- Use CSS scrolling rules based carousel to list papers, talks, web-experiments, and misc. artwork

- Use 🎨 [UnoCSS](https://github.com/antfu/unocss) to make buttons to links to github, youtube, paper website, blend files etc. (https://github.com/antfu/unocss/tree/main/packages/preset-icons)

- Can I write the cards using 🗒 [Markdown Support](https://github.com/antfu/vite-plugin-md) ?

- ☁️ Deploy on Netlify or Github pages?

- Use a  [input-knob](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/input-knob) to control a defocus filter on the website. Maybe make it astigmatic too, using a custom kernel.
